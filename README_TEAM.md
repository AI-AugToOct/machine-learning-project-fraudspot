## Implementation Guidelines

### For Feature Engineer (Feature Engineering)

- Focus on robust text analysis and NLP techniques
- Use NLTK, spaCy, or similar libraries for text processing
- Implement comprehensive feature extraction following the specifications
- Ensure features are normalized and properly scaled

### For ML Engineer (Machine Learning)

- Implement multiple model types (RandomForest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.)
- Use scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
- Implement proper cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Focus on model interpretability and feature importance

### For ML-OPS Engineer (Data Pipeline Specialist)

- Focus on comprehensive data loading from CSV files (Jadarat_data.csv, fake_job_postings.csv, arabic_job_postings_with_fraud.csv)
- Implement robust data preprocessing and cleaning pipelines
- Create comprehensive exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Develop Jupyter notebooks for data insights and fraud pattern analysis
- Ensure data quality validation and missing value handling

## Integration Points

1. **Data Pipeline â†’ Feature Engineering**: ML-OPS Engineer's clean data feeds into Feature Engineer's feature extraction
2. **Feature Engineering â†’ ML Pipeline**: Features from Feature Engineer feed into ML Engineer's training pipeline
3. **ML Pipeline â†’ Web App**: ML Engineer's prediction functions are called by the Streamlit app
4. **Cross-System Integration**: Essential utilities (text processing, validation) support all components
5. **Configuration**: All engineers use the centralized config.py for consistency

## Quality Standards

- All implementations must include comprehensive error handling
- Functions should log warnings for incomplete implementations
- Follow the established code style and documentation patterns
- Test thoroughly with the provided Streamlit interface

## Professional Development Notes

This project demonstrates enterprise-level software architecture with:

- Separation of concerns and modular design
- Professional documentation and stub generation
- Team collaboration workflows
- Production-ready error handling and logging
- Scalable caching and configuration systems

Each engineer's work contributes to a complete, production-ready fraud detection system suitable for real-world deployment.
