```python
from src.scraper.linkedin_scraper import scrape_job_posting
from src.features.feature_engineering import create_feature_vector
from src.models.predict import load_model, predict_fraud

# Scrape job posting
job_data = scrape_job_posting("https://linkedin.com/jobs/view/...")

# Extract features
features = create_feature_vector(job_data)

# Load model and predict
model = load_model()
prediction = predict_fraud(model, features)

print(f"Fraud Probability: {prediction['fraud_probability']:.2%}")
print(f"Risk Level: {prediction['risk_level']}")
